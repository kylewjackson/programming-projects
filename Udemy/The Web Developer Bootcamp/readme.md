1. **Scorekeeper Project** - Part of a code-a-long video, but I worked on the solution myself before watching. Keeps score between two players in games such as tic-tac-toe, allowing the user to set a goal count, increment player scores, and reset the game. Inputs/Buttons are disabled as determined by a game being in progress or completed.

2. **Color Game Project** - Code-a-long, but some snippets and refactoring were completed on my own. Picks a random RGB color value, and prompts the player to guess which square is the correct color. Contains Easy and Hard modes, and resets according to user interaction.
