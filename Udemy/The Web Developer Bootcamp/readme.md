1. **Scorekeeper Project** - Part of a code-a-long video, but I worked on the solution myself before watching. Keeps score between two players in games such as tic-tac-toe, allowing the user to set a goal count, increment player scores, and reset the game. Inputs/Buttons are disabled as determined by a game being in progress or completed.
